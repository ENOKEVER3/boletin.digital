## About

Boletín Digital is a school project developed by students from Fray Luis Beltrán de Salliqueló High School, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Its objective is to digitalize the quarterly delivery of grades, in addition to creating a school platform with the data of students, teachers and subjects. The system was designed to work in the school itself where it is developed.

## technical aspects

The system is developed in Java using Netbeans as IDE which helps among other things to simplify graphical programming. The database used is MySQL, which runs online, like the Apache server, on a VPS provided by Amazon AWS using XAMPP. This allows access to both the system and the development remotely.

## Demo
